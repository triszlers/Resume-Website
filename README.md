# triszlers.github.io
This is my first website published on Github Pages
Its intended purpose is to showoff ComSci projects in a resume-style website

index.html is the root file

images contains images used throughout
pages contains other webpages
projects contains projects in progress

style.css is the main styling file
transitions.css contains 3 page transitions - #1 is the only transition used as of now
    main.js handles these transitions

contact-handler.php handles emails through contact page
